// Coding Ninja :- https://www.codingninjas.com/studio/problems/algorithm-to-find-best-insert-position-in-sorted-array_839813

// Problem Statement :- Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
// You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

// Similar Problem :- First Bad Version

// Leetcode :- https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/description/

// Problem Statement :- You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
// Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.
// You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.


/* The isBadVersion API is defined in the parent class VersionControl.
      boolean isBadVersion(int version); */

         int start = 1;
